This project was my final project for GPR-200, and was done to demonstrate how to create multiple points of light within a scene draw using OpenGL.

The program uses imgui to adjust parameters within the scene, such as color and the orbital radii of the light emitters.

W A S D are used for moving the camera forward, backwards, left and right.

Q and E are used for moving the camera down and up

1 and 2 swaps between perspective and orthographic projections

Space toggles between drawing materials and drawing just the vertecies

Right click toggles the mouse cursor on and off, disabling mouse-look when the cursor is visible.

The contents of the EW folder are functions provided by the professor to ensure that all students had functional cameras, transformation matricies, and projections matricies.

The shader was written in OpenGL
